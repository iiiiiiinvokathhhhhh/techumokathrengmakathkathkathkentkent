<h2>Invoker/Lore</h2>
<p>1. Carl, the Invoker, is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of tINVOKER
More often than not, the hardest Dota 2 heroes are subjective to players’ preferences. For instance, the hero Invoker is basically a complicated hero with 10 skills at his disposal. Yet, Invoker is among the most popular heroes to date, and perhaps for good reasons. “The Wombo Combos.”

If there’s one thing that keeps Invoker players going, it’s most certainly the combos it can perform.

<h2>Invoker(Dota 2)</h2>
<p>Kael the Invoker is an Intelligence Dire hero from Dota 2. In its earliest, and some would say most potent form, magic was primarily the art of memory. It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories,

Armor:The first thing you’ll notice when playing invoker is his reliance on spells. Unlike other Dota heroes who can rely only on their auto-attacks to do damage, Invoker relies on a variety of spells for most of your attacks and abilities. He has low armor and health but remains one of the highest risk high reward characters in DOTA!

Invoker have 14 spells in total if you count the Quas, Wex, Exort, and Invoke. Normally we would say Invoker have 10 spell that you can use. If you’re trying to use an Invoker spell, it’s not very effective if you’re only using one at a time. If that is the case, then try to use them together or in a combo as it will deal more damage.Carl, the Invoker, is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even saving himself from danger. His three reagents can be upgraded up to level 7 which determines the power and potency of his invoked abilities, making it more powerful than an ordinary spell. Because of this, he can be played in almost any role possible. Invoker can be a carry, semi-carry, ganker, pusher, initiator or even support. His three reagents provide a passive bonus per instance, allowing for specialization at early levels and situational boosts at later levels. His extremely flexible nature allows him to use many different combinations of items effectively but also make him dependent on solid builds and a good gold advantage.

Invoker is available in Ability Draft, but due to his very unique nature, he has been heavily modified to work in that mode. See Invoker in Ability Draft for details. </p>
<h2>Where did the name invoker come from in Dota 2?</h2>
<p>Invoker's true name, Carl, originated as a mistranslated version of his Warcraft III name, Kael, in a fake 6.72 Chinese changelog on April 2011. IceFrog kept the name for Invoker's transition to Dota 2, where the old name Kael could not be used for copyright reasons.</p>
